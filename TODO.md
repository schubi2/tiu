* Use tiuidx archives by default
  * Don't download full images for a few needed blocks
  * Add support for second URL pointing to castr repository
* Cleanup
* Make new /usr snapshot default, even if not needed, to avoid people are able to delete the used /usr snapshot

# Building image:
* Take the build number from the build environment and add it to the manifest

# General:
* Implement normal (means nearly sileng), verbose and debug mode/flags
* Move more of the script code into the main code
* Cleanup of old snapshots with corresponding kernel/initrd
* Sign TIU archive and verify signature before accessing it

# Research
## EFI firmware/bootloader:
* have three partitions, which three entries in EFI firmware, usrA/usrB switch as default entry. All three should have independent boot loaders.
  * usrA
  * usrB
  * Rescue System
